北京时间6月1日晚，2022年ISC国际超级计算机竞赛总决赛结果在德国汉堡举行的ISC22国际超算大会上公布，我校学生超算队在线上赛道获得季军，清华大学代表队与中山大学代表队分获冠亚军。这是我校学生超算队首次亮相ISC国际超算竞赛。

On the evening of June 1, Beijing time, the results of the 2022 ISC International Supercomputing Competition Grand Final were announced at the ISC22 International Supercomputing Conference held in Hamburg, Germany, and our student supercomputing team won the third place in the online track, while the team from Tsinghua University and the team from Sun Yat-sen University won the first and second place. This is the first appearance of our student supercomputing team in ISC International Supercomputing Competition.

ISC国际超算大会由国际高性能计算指导委员会和国际超算组织主办，是世界上历史最悠久、欧洲顶级的面向国际高性能计算社区的会议和网络活动，而作为会议的重要组成部分，ISC超算竞赛是超级计算机领域的顶级赛事之一，每年举办一次，与中国ASC、美国SC并称为世界三大超算赛事。

The ISC International Supercomputing Conference, organized by the International Steering Committee for High Performance Computing and the International Supercomputing Organization, is the world's oldest and top European conference and networking event for the international high performance computing community, and as an important part of the conference, the ISC Supercomputing Competition is one of the top events in the supercomputing field, held once a year, and is known as one of the world's top three supercomputing The ISC Supercomputing Competition is one of the top supercomputing events in the field.

我校在去年APAC HPC-AI竞赛中夺冠后受邀参加今年的ISC线上竞赛，并与包括清华大学、苏黎世联邦理工学院、南洋理工大学、佐治亚理工学院等来自全球10个国家17支入围团队同台竞技。受新冠疫情影响，本次总决赛分线上与线下两个赛道举行，线上赛有12支队伍参加，线下赛有5支队伍参加，线上竞赛要求各参赛队伍在3月14日至5月20日期间，通过使用美国匹兹堡超级计算中心集群（Bridges-2）、加拿大多伦多大学超算集群（Niagara）和国际高性能计算与人工智能咨询委员会高性能中心集群（Thor）完成赛题的运行与优化。本次比赛的赛题包括开源计算化学软件NWChem、下一代全球数值天气预报和气候建模系统ICON、高阶有限差分湍流求解器Xcompact3d及其性能优化编程挑战Coding Challenge，同时还设置了社交媒体展示、采访答辩等环节。南科大学生超算团队成员在克服了各类技术问题、跨国沟通交流等困难后，凭借着高效的队内配合及以往比赛中积累的经验和策略，最终获得了本次大赛的季军。

After winning the APAC HPC-AI competition last year, our university was invited to participate in this year's ISC online competition and compete with 17 finalist teams from 10 countries around the world, including Tsinghua University, ETH Zurich, Nanyang Technological University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. Affected by the new crown epidemic, the finals were held in two tracks, online and offline, with 12 teams participating in the online competition and 5 teams in the offline competition. The online competition required teams to compete between March 14 and May 20 by using the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center cluster (Bridges-2) in the United States, the University of Toronto supercomputing cluster (Niagara) in Canada, and the International High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee High Performance Center Cluster (Thor) to run and optimize the competition questions. The competition questions included the open source computational chemistry software NWChem, the next-generation global numerical weather forecasting and climate modeling system ICON, the high-order finite-difference turbulence solver Xcompact3d and its performance-optimized programming challenge Coding Challenge, as well as social media presentations and interviews and defense sessions. After overcoming various technical problems, cross-country communication and other difficulties, the members of the SUSTech student supercomputing team won the third place in the competition with their efficient teamwork and the experience and strategies accumulated in previous competitions.

南方科技大学超算队作为新近出现的参赛队伍，在比赛中展现了不俗的实力，已在包括ASC、SC SCC、APAC HPC-AI等多项国际超算大赛中取得优异战绩。此次ISC竞赛由前南科大超算队队长南科大超算俱乐部发起人赵佳华（现在意大利帕多瓦大学攻读硕士学位）指导，计算机科学与工程系助理教授李卓钊老师、科学与工程计算中心主任工程师范靖博士、计算机科学与工程系18级本科生顾同舟提供技术协助，学生超算队队长由生物系18级本科生张懿麒担任，队员由计算机科学与工程系20级郑英炜，深港微电子学院18级袁通、樊青远，力学与航空航天工程系18级冀潇以及统计与数据科学系18级骆镒玲共5位本科同学组成。此次比赛后，南科大学生超算队成为国内为数不多的完整参加三大国际超算竞赛并获荣誉的高校团队（ASC19应用创新奖和一等奖，ASC 20-21一等奖，SC21最高性能奖和季军，ISC22季军）。

The SUSTech supercomputing team, as a newly emerged team, has shown remarkable strength in the competition and has already achieved excellent results in many international supercomputing competitions including ASC, SC SCC, and APAC HPC-AI. The ISC competition was directed by former SUSTech supercomputing team leader Jiahua Zhao, the initiator of the SUSTech Supercomputing Club (now pursuing a master's degree at the University of Padova, Italy), with technical assistance from Mr. Zhuozhao Li, Assistant Professor of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. Jing Fan, Director Engineer of the Center for Scientific and Engineering Computing, and Tongzhou Gu, an '18 undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and the student supercomputing team captained by Biology '18 The team leader was Zhang Yiqi, an undergraduate student from the Department of Biology, Grade 18, and the team members were Zheng Yingwei, Grade 20, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yuan Tong and Fan Qingyuan, Grade 18, Department of Microelectronics, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, Ji Xiao, Grade 18, Department of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering, and Luo Yiling, Grade 18, Department of Statistics and Data Science, a total of five undergraduate students. After this competition, the SUSTech Student Supercomputing Team became one of the few university teams in China that participated in all three major international supercomputing competitions and won honors (ASC19 Application Innovation Award and First Prize, ASC 20-21 First Prize, SC21 Top Performance Award and Third Prize, ISC22 Third Prize).
