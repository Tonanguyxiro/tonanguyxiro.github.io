近日，国际高性能计算及人工智能咨询委员会和世界大学生超算大赛（SCC）组委会于2021年度国际超算大会（SC21）期间先后宣布了第4届APAC HPC-AI竞赛和SC21 SCC两场赛事的成绩。南方科技大学荣获本届APAC HPC-AI竞赛第一名暨大赛总冠军和AI特别奖。同时，在SC21 SCC中取得了最高性能奖，总分排在清华大学和上海科技大学之后，位列第三。此外，由于在APAC HPC-AI竞赛中的优异表现，南科大超算队将获得明年在德国举行的ISC22国际大学生超算竞赛的一个保留席位。

Recently, the International High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee and the World Student Supercomputing Competition (SCC) Organizing Committee announced the results of the 4th APAC HPC-AI Competition and the SC21 SCC during the 2021 International Supercomputing Conference (SC21). SUSTech was awarded the first place of this year's APAC HPC-AI competition and the overall champion of the competition and the AI Special Award. Meanwhile, it achieved the highest performance award in SC21 SCC and ranked third in the total score after Tsinghua University and Shanghai University of Science and Technology. In addition, due to its excellent performance in the APAC HPC-AI competition, the SUSTech supercomputing team will be awarded a reserved seat in the ISC22 International Student Supercomputing Competition to be held in Germany next year.

自南科大超算俱乐部组建以来，南科大学生超算队已在包括ASC、APAC HPC-AI、SC SCC等多项国际大赛中取得优异战绩，此次两项竞赛中取得的成绩均为南科大历史最好成绩。

Since the formation of the SUSTech Supercomputing Club, the SUSTech Student Supercomputing Team has achieved excellent results in many international competitions, including ASC, APAC HPC-AI and SC SCC, and the results achieved in both competitions are the best results in the history of SUSTech.

全球超级计算大会（Supercomputing Conference，简称SC）是国际超算领域的顶级会议，国际影响力巨大。作为会议的重要组成部分，SCC（Student Cluster Competition）比赛是世界大学生超算顶级赛事之一，每年举办一次，吸引了世界各国和地区众多高校的目光。

The Supercomputing Conference (SC) is the top international conference in supercomputing with great international influence. As an important part of the conference, SCC (Student Cluster Competition) is one of the top supercomputing competitions for university students in the world, which is held once a year and attracts the attention of many universities in different countries and regions around the world.

受疫情影响，本次SCC竞赛在线上举办。为适应线上比赛的特殊情况，竞赛组委会今年设计了新的比赛规则，为各参赛队提供了一套固定配置的Oracle云集群和Azure云上的1500美元预算用于搭建个性化集群。各参赛队需用这两套集群完成特定赛题。此外，本次比赛还要求各队分析两套云集群的特点和赛题的性能特征，合理规划预算和计算时间，充分发挥出各集群的优势和性能，尽可能提高基准性能分数并高效地求解出一系列科学问题。

Affected by the epidemic, this SCC competition was held online. In order to adapt to the special situation of online competition, the competition organizing committee designed new competition rules this year, providing teams with a fixed configuration of Oracle Cloud Cluster and a budget of $1500 on Azure Cloud for building personalized clusters. Teams were required to use these two clusters to complete specific competition questions. In addition, the competition required teams to analyze the characteristics of the two cloud clusters and the performance characteristics of the problem, plan their budgets and computation times to fully exploit the strengths and performance of each cluster, improve their benchmark performance scores and solve a series of scientific problems as efficiently as possible.

今年的赛题包括性能基准测试程序LINPACK、HPCG、IO500，多尺度心脏模拟 Cardioid，量子材料模拟Quantum ESPRESSO，SC20论文复现题“大规模贝叶斯网络并行学习框架ramBLe”，同时还设置了海报设计展示、采访答辩等环节。

This year's problems include performance benchmarking programs LINPACK, HPCG, IO500, multi-scale heart simulation Cardioid, quantum material simulation Quantum ESPRESSO, SC20 paper reproduction problem "large-scale Bayesian network parallel learning framework ramBLe", as well as There were also poster design presentation and interview defense sessions.

南科大团队成员在克服了各类技术问题，远程比赛的时差，以及46小时连续比赛的疲劳等困难后，凭借着高效的队内沟通与配合，各队员强大的技战术实力与冷静的临场判断，以及在数次比赛中积累的经验和策略，获得了大赛LINPACK基准测试最高性能奖，同时取得了HPCG基准测试排名第一，多尺度心脏模拟 Cardioid赛题得分排名第二，SC20论文复现题得分排名第二，综合得分排名第三的好成绩。

After overcoming various technical problems, the time difference of remote competition, and the fatigue of 46 hours of continuous competition, the team members of SUSTech won the highest performance award of LINPACK benchmark test and the first place of HPCG benchmark test with their efficient team communication and cooperation, strong technical and tactical strength and calm judgment of each team member, as well as the experience and strategies accumulated in several competitions. The team also won the first place in the HPCG benchmark test, the second place in the multi-scale cardiac simulation Cardioid question, the second place in the SC20 paper reproduction question, and the third place in the overall score.
